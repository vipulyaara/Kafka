## Architecture

Kafka implements MVVM with interactors using all the latest android frameworks.<br/>
Parts of the architecture are inspired by [Tivi](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi). Download and audio features are copied from [DatMusic](https://github.com/alashow/datmusic-android).

The app uses [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html), [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), Material3, [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit), [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/), [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)

    <h2>
        I
    </h2>
    <p>
        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in
        his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
        little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
        sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
        His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
        helplessly as he looked.
    </p>
    <p>
        “What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room
        although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of
        textile samples lay spread out on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it
        there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a
        nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,
        raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard
        hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. “How about if I sleep a little bit longer
        and forget all this nonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do
        because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into
        that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where
        he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to
        look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there
        that he had never felt before.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen! Travelling day in
        and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at
        home, and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train
        connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you
        can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!” He felt a
        slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so
        that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered
        with lots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to
        feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it
        he was overcome by a cold shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
        He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”, he thought, “it
        makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of
        luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out
        the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I
        ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe
        that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have
        given in my notice a long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I
        think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right off his
        desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at
        your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the
        boss is hard of hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money together to
        pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I suppose—that’s definitely what
        I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my
        train leaves at five.”
    </p>
    <p>
        And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. “God in Heaven!” he
        thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later
        than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from
        the bed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly must have
        rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True,
        he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should
        he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like
        mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel
        particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his
        boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o’clock train go,
        he would have put in his report about Gregor’s not being there a long time ago. The office
        assistant was the boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he
        reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of
        service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the
        doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and
        accept the doctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one
        was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong
        in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so
        long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed,
        when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near his
        head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it was his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to
        go somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering,
        it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him,
        there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made
        out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer
        unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and
        explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother,
        yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably could not be
        noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation
        and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware
        that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking
        at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s
        wrong?” And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice:
        “Gregor! Gregor!” At the other side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you
        well? Do you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an
        effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and
        putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast,
        but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had no
        thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit,
        acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get
        dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next,
        as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by
        lying in bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by
        lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how
        his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt
        that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which
        was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and
        they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so
        exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but
        instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different
        directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them,
        then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do
        what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about
        painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said to himself, “so don’t
        keep trying to do it”.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he
        had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to
        be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly
        shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction,
        hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower
        part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his
        head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the
        bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at
        last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let
        himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to
        carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any
        price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there
        sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even
        harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and
        order to this chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in
        bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he
        could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself
        that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like
        this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but
        unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the
        view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to
        himself when the clock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And
        he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total
        stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.
    </p>
    <p>
        But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll definitely have to
        have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask
        what’s happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set
        himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same
        time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did
        so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably
        nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise
        he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if
        not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method was more of a game
        than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth—it occurred to him how simple
        everything would be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and
        the maid in mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms
        under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be
        patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would
        find a use. Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the
        doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at
        this thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to
        keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to
        make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be
        someone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only
        became all the more lively as they danced around. For a moment everything remained quiet.
        “They’re not opening the door”, Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But
        then of course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Gregor only
        needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the chief clerk
        himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they
        immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every
        one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so
        mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a
        couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of
        the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even necessary—did the chief clerk have
        to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so
        suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it?
        And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he
        swang himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t
        really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was
        also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable.
        He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in
        pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on the left. Gregor
        tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever
        happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff
        reply to this question, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could
        now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor’s sister whispered to
        him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief clerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to
        himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief clerk has come round and
        wants to know why you didn’t leave on the early train. We don’t know what to say to him. And
        anyway, he wants to speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be
        good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief clerk called “Good
        morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father
        continued to speak through the door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would
        Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly makes me
        cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed
        home every evening. He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train
        timetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little frame,
        for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s
        hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad
        you’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he’s so
        stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll
        be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he
        would not miss any word of the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of
        explaining it, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious. But on the
        other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then,
        fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business
        considerations.” “Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father
        impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room on his right there
        followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
        So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had
        not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and
        had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that
        happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before?
        There was no need to worry about things like that yet. Gregor was still there and had not
        the slightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on
        the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to
        let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily
        be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.
        And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing
        him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn’t know what was happening, they were
        worried, that would excuse their behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him, “what is wrong? You
        barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are
        causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just
        by the way—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. I’m
        speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a
        clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as
        a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.
        This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it’s
        true—it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to
        giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now that I
        see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on
        your behalf. And nor is your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all
        this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I
        don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has been very
        unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time of year to do especially good
        business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all,
        Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, “I’ll
        open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t
        been able to get up. I’m still in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just
        getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d thought. I’m
        quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite
        alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom
        of it last night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let you know
        at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please,
        don’t make my parents suffer! There’s no basis for any of the accusations you’re making;
        nobody’s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest
        contracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as well, these few hours of
        rest have given me strength. You don’t need to wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after
        you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”
    </p>
    <p>
        And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way
        over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had
        already had in bed—where he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the
        door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were
        being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight
        of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could
        rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset,
        and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o’clock. The first few times
        he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally
        gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in
        serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the
        back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he
        had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was
        saying.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his parents, “surely he’s not
        trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in tears, “he
        could be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”
        his sister called from the other side. They communicated across Gregor’s room. “You’ll have
        to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the
        way Gregor spoke just now?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a
        calmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!” his father called
        into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a locksmith here, now!”
        And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching
        open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so
        quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open;
        people often do in homes where something awful has happened.

        Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t understand his words any more,
        although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become
        used to the sound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and
        were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and
        that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the
        doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not
        really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order
        to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not
        too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he
        was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in
        the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or
        perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and
        threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the
        tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and
        then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed,
        unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of
        teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able
        to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of
        damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.
        “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the next room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly
        encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother
        too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it, keep hold of the lock!” And
        with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all
        his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned
        round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and
        hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. The
        clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his
        concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the
        locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be
        seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do
        it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He
        was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else,
        when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”, which sounded like the soughing of the
        wind. Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open
        mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor’s mother,
        her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his
        father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto
        the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down
        onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock
        Gregor back into his room. Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his
        eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.
    </p>
    <p>
        So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was
        still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his
        head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the
        day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of
        the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular
        line of windows piercing its façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large,
        individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on
        the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most
        important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a
        number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor
        when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face
        as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was
        open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the
        stairs where they began their way down below.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, “I’ll get
        dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and set off. Will you please just let me
        leave? You can see”, he said to the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my
        job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t earn my
        living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything
        accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but
        that’s just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that
        later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more
        diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m seriously in debt to our employer as
        well as having to look after my parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult
        situation, but I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any harder for
        me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at the office. I know that nobody
        likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of
        it. That’s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But you,
        sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in
        confidence, a better overview than the boss himself—it’s very easy for a businessman like
        him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And
        you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office,
        so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and
        it’s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even
        hear about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and
        that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going on without even knowing what
        caused them. Please, don’t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that
        I’m at least partly right!”
    </p>
    <p>
        But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with
        protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not
        keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door
        without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret
        prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he
        made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic.
        In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there
        were some supernatural force waiting to save him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood
        if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. That was something his
        parents did not understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that this
        job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry
        about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did
        think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and
        finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister
        were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully
        on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she
        would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But
        his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without considering
        that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or
        that his speech still might not—or probably would not—be understood, he let go of the door;
        pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,
        ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately
        over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous
        little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel
        alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure,
        they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he
        wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an
        end. He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the
        floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in
        herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread
        shouting: “Help, for pity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to
        see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did
        not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it;
        when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing;
        without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of
        coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had completely forgotten the
        chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at
        the sight of the flow of coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table
        and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though, had no time to
        spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on
        the banister, he looked back for the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be
        sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several
        steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of
        the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until
        then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief
        clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, Gregor’s father seized
        the chief clerk’s stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair,
        along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left,
        and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went.
        Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood,
        however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.
        Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled open a window, leant
        far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the
        street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and
        some of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as he drove him
        back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor had never had any practice in
        moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to
        turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he
        took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a
        lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father’s hand any moment. Eventually,
        though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite
        incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and
        with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but
        perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in
        fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to
        which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It was making
        Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that
        hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He was
        pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too
        narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his
        present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors
        so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the idea that
        Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have
        allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the
        doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the
        harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now
        more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself
        into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself,
        he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully
        injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been
        able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air
        while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father
        gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him
        flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick,
        then, finally, all was quiet.
